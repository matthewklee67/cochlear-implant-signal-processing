# cochlearSignalProcessing
BME 252 Term Project

Wrote a MATLAB script to take an audio file input, filter the signal into different frequency bands and detect the envelopes.
Outputs an audio file that is composed of the normalized average of all frequency bands (for a single-channel cochlear implant).
